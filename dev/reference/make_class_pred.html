    <dl><dt>...</dt>
<dd><p>Numeric vectors corresponding to class probabilities. There should
be one for each level in <code>levels</code>, and <em>it is assumed that the vectors
are in the same order as <code>levels</code></em>.</p></dd>


<dt>levels</dt>
<dd><p>A character vector of class levels. The length should be the
same as the number of selections made through <code>...</code>, or length <code>2</code>
for <code>make_two_class_pred()</code>.</p></dd>


<dt>ordered</dt>
<dd><p>A single logical to determine if the levels should be regarded
as ordered (in the order given). This results in a <code>class_pred</code> object
that is flagged as ordered.</p></dd>


<dt>min_prob</dt>
<dd><p>A single numeric value. If any probabilities are less than
this value (by row), the row is marked as <em>equivocal</em>.</p></dd>


<dt>estimate</dt>
<dd><p>A single numeric vector corresponding to the class
probabilities of the first level in <code>levels</code>.</p></dd>


<dt>threshold</dt>
<dd><p>A single numeric value for the threshold to call a row to
be labeled as the first value of <code>levels</code>.</p></dd>


<dt>buffer</dt>
<dd><p>A numeric vector of length 1 or 2 for the buffer around
<code>threshold</code> that defines the equivocal zone (i.e., <code>threshold - buffer[1]</code> to
<code>threshold + buffer[2]</code>). A length 1 vector is recycled to length 2. The
default, <code>NULL</code>, is interpreted as no equivocal zone.</p></dd>
